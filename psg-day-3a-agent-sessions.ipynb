Addressing and mitigating this bias is a major focus.\n*   **Regulatory Approval:** Navigating the complex regulatory landscape for AI-powered medical devices and software is a significant hurdle.\n*   **Explainability and Trust:** Making AI decisions understandable and trustworthy for clinicians and patients is crucial for adoption.\n*   **Integration into Existing Workflows:** Seamlessly integrating AI tools into the current healthcare infrastructure and workflows is an ongoing challenge.\n\n**To get the *absolute latest* news, I recommend checking reputable sources such as:**\n\n*   **Major medical journals:** *The Lancet*, *NEJM*, *JAMA*, *Nature Medicine*, *Cell*\n*   **Technology and healthcare news outlets:** *STAT News*, *Fierce Healthcare*, *Healthcare Dive*, *TechCrunch*, *MIT Technology Review*\n*   **Reputable AI research institutions and companies:** DeepMind, Google Health, Microsoft Healthcare, academic research labs.\n*   **Conferences and reports:** Look for summaries from recent major AI and healthcare conferences.\n\nIf you have a specific area of AI in healthcare you're interested in, feel free to ask, and I can provide more detailed information based on my knowledge base!\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Are there any new developments in drug discovery?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Yes, absolutely! Drug discovery is one of the most dynamic and exciting areas where AI is making significant inroads. While I can't give you real-time breaking news from today, I can highlight **key recent developments and ongoing trends in AI-driven drug discovery** that were prominent up to my last knowledge update (June 2024).\n\nHere are some of the most important new developments and areas of focus:\n\n*   **Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n    *   **De Novo Design:** This is a huge area. Instead of screening existing libraries of compounds, generative AI models (like GANs, VAEs, and transformer-based models) are being used to *design entirely new molecules* from scratch. These models learn the underlying principles of chemical structure and properties to create novel compounds with desired characteristics, such as high binding affinity to a specific target, good ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity) profiles, and synthesizability.\n    *   **Conditional Generation:** Researchers are increasingly able to guide these generative models by providing specific constraints – for example, designing a molecule that targets a particular protein pocket, has a certain molecular weight, or avoids specific chemical substructures known to be toxic.\n\n*   **AI for Target Identification and Validation:**\n    *   **Multi-omics Integration:** AI is crucial for integrating and analyzing vast datasets from genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics. This helps identify novel disease targets by uncovering complex biological pathways and understanding the molecular basis of disease.\n    *   **Predicting Target Druggability:** AI models are being developed to predict whether a newly identified biological target is likely to be \"druggable\" – meaning that a molecule can be designed to interact with it effectively to achieve a therapeutic effect.\n\n*   **Accelerating Pre-clinical Testing and Optimization:**\n    *   **In Silico ADMET Prediction:** AI models are becoming more accurate at predicting a drug candidate's absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity profiles *before* expensive and time-consuming lab experiments. This helps in selecting the most promising candidates and reducing attrition rates.\n    *   **Predicting Efficacy:** AI can analyze preclinical data and even early clinical trial data to predict a drug's potential efficacy, helping to refine dosing and identify patient subpopulations most likely to respond.\n    *   **Optimizing Synthesis Routes:** AI can help design more efficient and cost-effective chemical synthesis pathways for drug candidates.\n\n*   **AI in Clinical Trial Optimization:**\n    *   **Patient Selection and Stratification:** AI can identify patient populations most likely to benefit from a particular drug or to respond positively to a clinical trial, leading to more successful trials.\n    *   **Predicting Trial Success/Failure:** AI models can analyze early trial data to predict the likelihood of success or failure, allowing for earlier decision-making and resource allocation.\n    *   **Decentralized Clinical Trials:** AI can assist in managing and analyzing data from remote patient monitoring devices used in decentralized clinical trials.\n\n*   **Focus on Undruggable Targets:**\n    *   AI is showing promise in tackling historically \"undruggable\" targets, such as certain protein-protein interactions (PPIs), by designing novel molecular modalities or identifying allosteric binding sites.\n\n**Key Players and Trends:**\n\n*   **Biotech Startups:** Many innovative startups are leveraging AI as their core technology for drug discovery (e.g., Insilico Medicine, Exscientia, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Atomwise).\n*   **Big Pharma Collaborations:** Major pharmaceutical companies are increasingly partnering with or acquiring AI-driven biotech firms, or building their own internal AI capabilities, to accelerate their R&D pipelines.\n*   **Open Science and Data Sharing:** While proprietary data is still prevalent, there's a growing trend towards sharing datasets and AI models within the research community, which can foster faster innovation.\n\n**In summary, AI is not just a theoretical concept in drug discovery anymore; it's actively being used to:**\n\n*   **Discover entirely new drug candidates.**\n*   **Identify novel biological targets.**\n*   **Predict drug properties and potential issues early on.**\n*   **Streamline and de-risk the entire R&D process.**\n\nThe goal is to drastically reduce the time, cost, and failure rate associated with bringing new medicines to patients.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Okay, you're asking about the **second development** I mentioned, which was:\n\n**AI for Target Identification and Validation**\n\nLet's dive deeper into what this means and why it's so significant in drug discovery.\n\n**What is a \"Drug Target\"?**\n\nBefore we talk about AI's role, it's important to understand what a drug target is. In the context of most traditional drug discovery, a drug target is typically a **specific molecule (usually a protein, but sometimes a nucleic acid like RNA) within the body that plays a key role in a disease process.**\n\nThe idea is that a drug can be designed to:\n*   **Inhibit** the target's activity (e.g., block an enzyme that's overactive in a disease).\n*   **Activate** the target's activity (e.g., stimulate a receptor that's not working properly).\n*   **Modulate** the target's activity in some other way.\n\nBy interacting with the target, the drug aims to alter the disease's progression or alleviate its symptoms.\n\n**The Challenge of Finding the Right Target:**\n\n*   **Complexity of Biology:** The human body is incredibly complex. Diseases often involve intricate networks of interacting genes, proteins, and pathways. Identifying *which* specific component is the most crucial driver of a disease, and therefore the best target for a drug, is a massive challenge.\n*   **Data Overload:** We have an unprecedented amount of biological data being generated – from genetic sequencing (genomics), protein studies (proteomics), gene expression levels (transcriptomics), metabolic profiles (metabolomics), and more. Analyzing this data manually or with traditional statistical methods is like trying to drink from a firehose.\n*   **\"Undruggable\" Targets:** Even when targets are identified, some are notoriously difficult to design drugs for. This could be due to their structure, their location, or their essential role in normal biological functions, making it hard to develop drugs that are effective and safe.\n\n**How AI is Revolutionizing Target Identification and Validation:**\n\nAI, particularly **machine learning and deep learning**, is exceptionally good at finding patterns and making predictions within large, complex datasets. Here's how it's applied:\n\n1.  **Multi-omics Data Integration:**\n    *   **What it is:** AI algorithms can simultaneously analyze data from different biological \"omics\" layers (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, etc.) for the same patient or cell sample.\n    *   **Why it's powerful:** By seeing how genes, proteins, and metabolic pathways are interconnected and how they change in diseased states compared to healthy states, AI can uncover novel relationships and pathways that wouldn't be apparent from looking at each data type in isolation. This can reveal previously unknown key players in disease.\n    *   **Example:** An AI might find that a specific gene mutation (genomics) leads to the overproduction of a certain protein (proteomics), which in turn disrupts a metabolic pathway (metabolomics) that's critical for cell survival in a particular disease. This protein then becomes a strong candidate for a drug target.\n\n2.  **Identifying Causal Relationships (Not Just Correlations):**\n    *   **What it is:** Traditional statistical methods often find correlations (e.g., \"gene X is often mutated when disease Y is present\"). AI, especially with advanced techniques like causal inference, can help researchers move towards understanding if a particular molecular change *causes* or *drives* the disease, rather than just being associated with it.\n    *   **Why it's powerful:** Targeting a causal driver is much more likely to be effective than targeting a molecule that's merely correlated with the disease.\n\n3.  **Predicting Target Druggability:**\n    *   **What it is:** Once a potential target is identified, AI can analyze its structural characteristics, known binding sites, and its role in cellular processes to predict the likelihood of successfully designing a drug that can bind to it and modulate its activity effectively and safely.\n    *   **Why it's powerful:** This helps prioritize which potential targets are most promising for drug development efforts, saving time and resources by focusing on targets with a higher probability of success.\n\n4.  **Leveraging Real-World Evidence (RWE) and Electronic Health Records (EHRs):**\n    *   **What it is:** AI can analyze anonymized patient data from EHRs, insurance claims, and other real-world sources.\n    *   **Why it's powerful:** This data can reveal how diseases progress in diverse populations, how different treatments are used in practice, and potential side effects or unexpected benefits. This can help identify novel targets or stratify patients based on their disease mechanisms, informing target selection for new therapies.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n*   **Speed:** AI can analyze massive datasets in hours or days, a task that would take researchers years or even be impossible with traditional methods.\n*   **Novelty:** AI can uncover targets that might not have been obvious to human researchers, potentially leading to breakthroughs for diseases with limited treatment options.\n*   **Precision:** By understanding the specific molecular mechanisms of a disease, AI can help identify targets that are highly relevant to a particular patient subgroup.\n*   **Reduced Risk:** Identifying and validating targets early and more robustly can reduce the number of drug candidates that fail in later, more expensive stages of development.\n\nIn essence, AI acts as an incredibly powerful \"biological detective,\" sifting through mountains of data to find the most crucial levers (targets) that, when pulled by a drug, can make a meaningful difference in treating a disease.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the main companies involved in **AI for Target Identification and Validation**.

Google Cloud also offers AI/ML platforms that are used by drug discovery companies.\n*   **Microsoft:** Provides cloud computing power (Azure) and AI/ML tools that drug discovery companies utilize. They also have initiatives in AI for healthcare.\n*   **Nvidia:** Their GPUs are the backbone of much of the AI computation, including deep learning models used for drug discovery. They also have specialized software and platforms for life sciences.\n\n**4. Data and AI Platform Providers:**\n\nSome companies focus on building the foundational AI/ML platforms or curating the necessary biological data that enables target identification.\n\n*   **Companies providing specialized bioinformatics and AI/ML platforms:** These can range from smaller software companies to larger enterprise solutions that help manage and analyze biological data for drug discovery.\n\n**Key Trends in Company Involvement:**\n\n*   **Partnerships and Collaborations:** It's very common to see collaborations between AI-native companies and big pharma, where the AI company brings its technology and the pharma company brings its scientific expertise, pipelines, and clinical trial capabilities.\n*   **Acquisitions:** Larger pharma companies are acquiring promising AI drug discovery startups to integrate their technology in-house.\n*   **Internal AI Teams:** Many large pharmaceutical companies are building substantial internal AI and data science teams to develop their own proprietary AI tools and platforms.\n\nThe landscape is constantly evolving, with new players emerging and existing ones expanding their focus.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
