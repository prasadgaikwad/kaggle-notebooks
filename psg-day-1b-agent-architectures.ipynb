Imagine a world where your software isn't just a single, rigid entity, but a dynamic, collaborative team of intelligent components. This isn't science fiction; it's the power of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), and it's poised to transform how you build software.\n\nOne of the most significant benefits of MAS is **enhanced modularity and scalability**. Instead of one giant codebase, MAS breaks down complex problems into smaller, independent, and specialized \"agents.\" This makes your system significantly more manageable. Need to handle increased user load? Simply add more agents. Developers can focus on specific agents without getting lost in the entire system's complexity, leading to more agile adaptation and focused development.\n\nFurthermore, MAS dramatically boosts **robustness and fault tolerance**. With no single point of failure, if one agent encounters an issue, others can often pick up the slack. This distributed nature leads to more resilient applications with self-healing capabilities, where agents can monitor and recover from problems automatically. Even if some agents are unavailable, the system can often continue providing core functionality, offering graceful degradation rather than complete failure.\n\nFinally, MAS unlocks **improved problem-solving and intelligence**.

The `SequentialAgent` and `ParallelAgent` produce their final output and then stop. This 'one-shot' approach isn't good for tasks that require refinement and quality control. What if the first draft of our story is bad? We have no way to review it and ask for a rewrite.\n\n**The Solution: Iterative Refinement**\n\nWhen a task needs to be improved through cycles of feedback and revision, you can use a `LoopAgent`. A `LoopAgent` runs a set of sub-agents repeatedly *until a specific condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.* This creates a refinement cycle, allowing the agent system to improve its own work over and over.\n\n**Use Loop when:** Iterative improvement is needed, quality refinement matters, or you need repeated cycles.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [loop agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Story Writing & Critique Loop**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"Initial Prompt\"] -- > B[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    B -- >|story| C[\"Critic Agent\"]\n    C -- >|critique| D{\"Iteration < Max<br>AND<br>Not Approved?\"}\n    D -- >|Yes| B\n    D -- >|No| E[\"Final Story\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style C fill:#ffcccc\n    style D fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"250\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/loop-agent.png\" alt=\"Loop Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5.1 Example: Iterative Story Refinement\n\nLet's build a system with two agents:\n\n1. **Writer Agent** - Writes a draft of a short story\n2. **Critic Agent** - Reviews and critiques the short story to suggest improvements","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent runs ONCE at the beginning to create the first draft.\ninitial_writer_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"InitialWriterAgent\",\n    model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n    instruction=\"\"\"Based on the user's prompt, write the first draft of a short story (around 100-150 words).\n    Output only the story text, with no introduction or explanation.\"\"\",\n    output_key=\"current_story\", # Stores the first draft in the state.\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\")","metadata":{"id":"a2b8WlJoBtHF","outputId":"13ed1e15-dcf9-4e1d-ad1e-fb18ee793de5","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-10T03:06:02.375299Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-10T03:06:02.375606Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-10T03:06:02.382729Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-10T03:06:02.375583Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-10T03:06:02.381470Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":20},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent's only job is to provide feedback or the approval signal.

For thirty years, the lighthouse had been his world, its beam a faithful companion. But this map was different. It had washed ashore, tucked inside a barnacle-encrusted chest. The parchment itself shimmered, and the markings… they weren't of any known land. Islands like scattered jewels pulsed with a soft, phosphorescent light. One island, in particular, glowed with an intensity that drew his gaze, whispering of forgotten harbors and treasures untold.

Elias's established routine and the sudden appearance of the magical map create immediate intrigue.\n\nHere are a few suggestions for improvement:\n\n1.  **Show, Don't Just Tell, Elias's Routine:** While you mention Elias has been a lighthouse keeper for thirty years and the beam is his companion, you could *show* this more actively in the opening. Perhaps a brief description of his evening duties, the predictable rhythm of his life, before the discovery of the map, to heighten the contrast with the extraordinary find.\n2.  **Amplify the Mystery of the Map's Origin:** The map washing ashore in a chest is a good start, but adding a touch more mystery to *how* it arrived could be impactful. Was the chest unusual in appearance beyond the barnacles? Did it have any markings or strange materials that hinted at its journey?\n3.  **Flesh Out Elias's Internal Conflict:** You mention a \"tremor of something akin to fear, but stronger, of exhilarating possibility.\" This is excellent! You could expand on this slightly by contrasting his ingrained caution (thirty years of routine) with this new, powerful urge. What specifically about the glowing island calls to him beyond \"forgotten harbors and treasures untold\"? Does it evoke a past longing, a dormant spirit?\nRefinerAgent > Elias ran a calloused thumb over the worn railing of the lighthouse gallery. Thirty years. Thirty years of the same three-hundred-and-sixty-degree sweep of the beam, a silent, rhythmic pulse against the inky canvas of the night. His world was one of predictable tides, of the salt spray that misted his spectacles, of the solitary meals that echoed in the stone tower. Tonight, like countless nights before, he’d checked the lamp, polished the great lens, and listened to the familiar groan of the foghorn.\n\nIt was during his dawn patrol of the rocky shoreline, before the sun had fully banished the stars, that he found it. Tucked amongst the jagged rocks, snagged by a rogue wave, was a chest. It was ancient, its wood warped and stained by the sea, a thick beard of barnacles clinging to its surface like a grotesque mask. But it was the faint, almost imperceptible hum emanating from within that drew him closer. With considerable effort, he pried it open. Inside, nestled amongst rotted velvet, lay a map.\n\nIt wasn't parchment, not exactly. It felt like woven moonlight, cool and silken to the touch. And the markings… they weren't ink, but lines of pure, captured starlight. Islands, scattered like fallen constellations, pulsed with an otherworldly, phosphorescent glow. One island, a vibrant emerald amidst the azure, throbbed with an intensity that seemed to sing directly to his soul. It whispered not just of forgotten harbors and untold treasures, but of a yearning he hadn't realized he possessed, a dormant spark rekindled by the map's ethereal light.\n\nA tremor ran through Elias, a sensation entirely alien to his seasoned practicality. Thirty years of meticulously charting safe passages, of guarding against the sea's fury, had forged a deep-seated caution. Yet, this map, this impossible artifact from an unknown ocean, ignited something far more potent than fear. It was the exhilarating promise of the unknown, a siren song calling to a spirit he thought long-doused by routine. The sea had always been his domain, but now, it seemed, it held secrets far grander than he had ever imagined. This map didn't just promise adventure; it promised a rediscovery of himself.\nCriticAgent > APPROVED\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts.
