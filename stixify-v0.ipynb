Using Google GenAI, the notebook parses a cybersecurity news article, extracts key threat entities, and transforms them into STIX 2.1 objects mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.\n\n## What is Threat Intelligence?\nThreat Intelligence refers to evidence-based knowledge about existing or emerging cyber threats. It includes details on threat actors, malware, attack techniques, indicators of compromise (IOCs), and their relationships. Organizations use threat intelligence to understand adversaries, anticipate attacks, and improve their defenses.\n\n## What is STIX 2.1?\nSTIX (Structured Threat Information Expression) 2.1 is a standardized language for representing and sharing cyber threat intelligence.\n\nIt defines a JSON-based format for describing threat actors, malware, campaigns, TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures), indicators, and their relationships.\nSTIX enables interoperability between security tools and organizations, making it easier to share actionable intelligence.\n\n## What is MITRE ATT&CK?\nMITRE ATT&CK is a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.\n\nIt organizes threat behaviors into tactics (the “why”) and techniques (the “how”).\nSecurity teams use ATT&CK to map, detect, and respond to adversary actions, and to improve threat detection and incident response.\n\n## Summary:\nThis notebook automates the extraction of threat intelligence from articles and structures it using STIX 2.1 and MITRE ATT&CK, making the intelligence actionable for security operations.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This cell ensures the notebook environment has all required Python packages.  \nUninstalls `jupyterlab` to avoid conflicts.\\n- Installs/updates `google-genai` for Google Generative AI access.\\n- Installs `beautifulsoup4` for HTML parsing.\nInstalls `requests` for HTTP requests.\n\nRun this cell first to set up dependencies.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip uninstall -qqy jupyterlab  # Remove unused conflicting packages\n!pip install -U -q \"google-genai==1.7.0\"\n!pip install beautifulsoup4\n!pip install requests","metadata":{"_uuid":"86749e3b-3060-4483-803c-9ee6e882ae87","_cell_guid":"b9e64224-eff8-44bc-9d29-fffa8c601e22","trusted":true,"collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from google import genai\nfrom google.genai import types\n\ngenai.__version__","metadata":{"_uuid":"dfe26e27-926b-4273-a6fb-66437c0ac54b","_cell_guid":"5bdaf392-63ad-49a7-aa01-6140d4ea5145","trusted":true,"collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Set up your API key\nTo run the following cell, your API key must be stored it in a Kaggle secret named GOOGLE_API_KEY.\n\nIf you don't already have an API key, you can grab one from AI Studio.
