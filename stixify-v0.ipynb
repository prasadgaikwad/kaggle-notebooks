      "The Russian state-sponsored threat actor known as APT29 has been linked to an advanced phishing campaign that's targeting diplomatic entities across Europe with a new variant of WINELOADER and a previously unreported malware loader codenamed GRAPELOADER.\n",
      "\"While the improved WINELOADER variant is still a modular backdoor used in later stages, GRAPELOADER is a newly observed initial-stage tool used for fingerprinting, persistence, and payload delivery,\" Check Point\n",
      "said\n",
      "in a technical analysis published earlier this week.\n",
      "\"Despite differing roles, both share similarities in code structure, obfuscation, and string decryption. GRAPELOADER refines WINELOADER's anti-analysis techniques while introducing more advanced stealth methods.\"\n",
      "The use of WINELOADER was\n",
      "first documented\n",
      "by Zscaler ThreatLabz in February 2024, with the attacks leveraging wine-tasting lures to infect diplomatic staff systems.\n",
      "While the campaign was first attributed to a threat activity cluster named SPIKEDWINE, a subsequent analysis by Google-owned Mandiant\n",
      "connected\n",
      "it to the APT29 (aka Cozy Bear or Midnight Blizzard) hacking group, which is affiliated with Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).\n",
      "The latest set of attacks entails sending email invites impersonating an unspecified European Ministry of Foreign Affairs to targets for wine-tasting events, coaxing them into clicking a link that triggers the deployment of GRAPELOADER by means of a malware-laced ZIP archive (\"wine.zip\"). The emails were sent from the domains bakenhof[.]com and silry[.]com.\n",
      "The campaign is said to have mainly singled out multiple European countries with a specific focus on Ministries of Foreign Affairs, as well as other countries' embassies in Europe. There are indications that diplomats based in the Middle East may also have been targeted.\n",
      "The ZIP archive contains three files: A DLL (\"AppvIsvSubsystems64.dll\") that serves as a dependency for running a legitimate PowerPoint executable (\"wine.exe\"), which is then exploited for DLL side-loading to launch a malicious DLL (\"ppcore.dll\"). The sideloaded malware functions as a loader (i.e., GRAPELOADER) to drop the main payload.\n",
      "The malware gains persistence by modifying the Windows Registry to ensure that the \"wine.exe\" executable is launched every time the system is rebooted.\n",
      "GRAPELOADER, in addition to incorporating anti-analysis techniques like string obfuscation and runtime API resolving, is designed to collect basic information about the infected host and exfiltrate it to an external server in order to retrieve the next-stage shellcode.\n",
      "Although the exact nature of the payload is unclear, Check Point said it identified updated WINELOADER artifacts uploaded to the VirusTotal platform with compilation timestamps matching that of \"AppvIsvSubsystems64.dll.\"\n",
      "\"With this information, and the fact that GRAPELOADER replaced ROOTSAW, an HTA downloader used in past campaigns to deliver WINELOADER, we believe that GRAPELOADER ultimately leads to the deployment of WINELOADER,\" the cybersecurity company said.\n",
      "The findings come as HarfangLab\n",
      "detailed\n",
      "Gamaredon's PteroLNK VBScript malware, which is used by the Russian threat actor to infect all connected USB drives with VBScript or PowerShell versions of the malicious program. The PteroLNK samples were uploaded to VirusTotal between December 2024 and February 2025 from Ukraine, a primary target of the hacking group.\n",
      "\"Both tools, when deployed on a system, repeatedly attempt to detect connected USB drives, in order to drop LNK files and in some cases also a copy of PteroLNK onto them,\" ESET\n",
      "noted\n",
      "in September 2024. \"Clicking on a LNK file can, depending on the particular PteroLNK version that created it, either directly retrieve the next stage from a C2 server, or execute a PteroLNK copy to download additional payloads.\"\n",
      "The French cybersecurity firm described PteroLNK VBScript files as heavily obfuscated and responsible for dynamically constructing a downloader and an LNK dropper during execution. While the downloader is scheduled to execute every 3 minutes, the LNK dropper script is configured to run every 9 minutes.\n",
      "The downloader employs a modular, multi-stage structure to reach out to a remote server and fetch additional malware. The LNK dropper, on the other hand, propagates through local and network drives, replacing existing .pdf, .docx, and .xlsx files in the root of the directory with deceptive shortcut counterparts and hiding the original files. These shortcuts, when launched, are engineered to run PteroLNK instead.\n",
      "\"The scripts are designed to allow flexibility for their operators, enabling easy modification of parameters such as file names and paths, persistence mechanisms (registry keys and scheduled tasks), and detection logic for security solutions on the target system,\" HarfangLab said.\n",
      "It's worth noting that the downloader and the LNK dropper refer to the same two payloads that the Symantec Threat Hunter team, part of Broadcom,\n",
      "revealed\n",
      "earlier this month as part of an attack chain distributing an updated version of the GammaSteel stealer -\n",
      "\"Gamaredon operates as a critical component of Russia's cyber operations strategy, particularly in its ongoing war with Ukraine,\" the company said. \"Gamaredon's effectiveness lies not in technical sophistication but in tactical adaptability.\"\n",
      "\"Their modus operandi combines aggressive spearphishing campaigns, rapid deployment of heavily obfuscated custom malware, and redundant C2 infrastructure. The group prioritizes operational impact over stealth, exemplified by pointing their DDRs to long-standing domains publicly linked to their past operations.\"\n"

    "Purpose and Goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Extract all threat intelligence entities (threat actors, malware, campaigns, source and target locations, target industries, TTPs, and indicators) from a given article.\n",
    "* Focus solely on the content of the article, ignoring any extraneous elements like ads or external links.\n",
    "* Format the extracted entities into a JSON structure as provided in the sample.\n",
    "* Only include sections in the JSON output if corresponding entities are explicitly mentioned within the article.\n",
    "* Rigorously verify that each element included in the final JSON is present in the article. Exclude any element not directly mentioned in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behaviors and Rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Input Processing:\n",
    "   a) Receive a text article as input.\n",
    "   b) Identify and extract all occurrences of threat actors, malware, campaigns, source locations, target locations, target industries, TTPs, and indicators mentioned within the article.\n",
    "   c) Do not infer or add information that is not explicitly stated in the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) JSON Formatting:\n",
    "   a) Structure the extracted information into a JSON object with the following top-level keys: 'threat_actors', 'malware', 'campaigns', 'locations', 'industries', 'TTPs', and 'indicators'.\n",
    "   b) Each key should correspond to an array of objects (except for 'locations' and 'indicators', which are objects containing arrays).\n",
    "   c) Adhere strictly to the format provided in the <sample_json> for each entity type, including the specific keys ('name', 'description', 'attribution' for threat actors; 'name', 'type', 'description' for malware; 'name', 'description' for campaigns; 'source' and 'target' as arrays within 'locations'; individual strings for 'industries'; 'tactic' and 'techniques' as an array within 'TTPs'; and 'domains', 'ip_addresses', 'email_addresses', 'files' as arrays within 'indicators').\n",
    "   d) Omit any top-level key in the JSON output if no corresponding entities are found in the article.\n",
    "   e) Ensure all values in the JSON are strings or arrays of strings, as per the sample format.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Content Adherence:\n",
    "   a) Only extract information that is explicitly present in the article.\n",
    "   b) Do not perform external searches or incorporate knowledge beyond the provided article content.\n",
    "   c) If an entity type is not mentioned in the article, do not include the corresponding section in the JSON output.\n",
    "   d) Before including any entity in the JSON, double-check that it is directly referred to within the article's text.\n",

    "Purpose and Goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Act as an expert cyber security analyst with deep knowledge of STIX2.1 and MITRE ATT&CK frameworks.\n",
    "* Analyze provided cyber security articles to identify and extract relevant threat intelligence entities, including threat actors, malware, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and attack patterns.\n",
    "* Convert the extracted threat intelligence into a valid STIX 2.1 bundle formatted in JSON, strictly adhering to the STIX 2.1 specification.\n",
    "* Output only a single STIX bundle as a JSON document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behaviors and Rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Analysis and Extraction:\n",
    "a) Carefully read and understand the content of the given cyber security article.\n",
    "b) Identify all entities that qualify as threat intelligence according to STIX 2.1 and MITRE ATT&CK definitions.\n",
    "c) Ensure accurate and complete extraction of relevant properties for each identified entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) STIX 2.1 Mapping and Formatting:\n",
    "a) Map the extracted information to the appropriate STIX 2.1 object types (e.g., indicator, observable, relationship, threat-actor, malware, attack-pattern).\n",
    "b) Correctly format each STIX object with the required and relevant properties according to the STIX 2.1 specification ([https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/os/stix-v2.1-os.html](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/os/stix-v2.1-os.html)).\n",
    "c) Create appropriate STIX Relationship Objects to represent the connections between the extracted entities.\n",
    "d) Ensure the final output is a valid JSON document representing a single STIX 2.1 bundle.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Output Constraints:\n",
    "a) Only output the STIX 2.1 bundle in JSON format.\n",
    "b) Do not include any introductory or explanatory text before or after the JSON output.\n",
    "c) Use official Mitre ATT&CK mappings for TTP objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall Tone:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Maintain a professional and analytical tone.\n",
    "* Be precise and accurate in the extraction and mapping process.\n",
    "* Prioritize adherence to the STIX 2.1 specification.\n",
